          Despite the significant progress India has made, a large number of
          people still face the risk of food insecurity. The COVID-19 pandemic
          has further exacerbated the challenge of hunger in our country.
          <br></br>
          <br></br> As a response to the devastating consequences of the
          pandemic, Feeding India by Zomato launched the Daily Feeding Program
          in January 2021 to provide daily meal support to the most vulnerable
          families.
